                    <p id="intro-text">If you are like us, you may be looking for an "answer" to your prayers about a supplemental, or even replacement, home income. While there are many, many options out there, a lot of them come with skeletons in the closet. For example, many MLMs out there will have you working incredibly hard for very little results. Unless you get in on the ground floor, your really do not stand a chance of a healthy replacement income. Other options, while decent, usually have a rigid schedule, which makes them closer to an out of home job. But, there are a few that can truly bring the financial and time freedom that you are looking for, and come with the added bonus of truly providing a great product to your clients. We believe we have found that option, and we are looking to share it.</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, you may just be looking for some great, and all natural products (Absolutely no toxins, your kids can even eat it!) for your family. Again, we believe we found that option as well, and are looking to share.</p>

                    <p>Hello, we are the Kramers. Ryan, Cassie, and little EmmaLeigh. We are a simple family looking for the american dream of financial freedom. We moved to utah in 2014, and shortly after had our first child. We have been pursuing various avenues of income, but ulitmately dream of being our own bosses, having residual income, and the freedom of time that it brings.</p>

                    <p>We started this business when it was introduced to us by some friends. We spent a couple evenings doing extensive research, and pondering and praying about it, before feeling it was the right path for us. In a remarkable coincidence (or revelation if you believe in it), Cassie's mom had at the same time been looking to re-sign up as a customer with the company. She had used the products in the past, and loved them. This was the final answer we were looking for. We signed up in June of 2016, and are rapidly building our business.</p>
